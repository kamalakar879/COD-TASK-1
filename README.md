### Description

This code implements a simple calculator using the tkinter library in Python, which provides a graphical user interface for performing basic arithmetic operations. The calculator can handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the code:

#### Function Definitions

1. *button_click(number)*:
    - This function is called when a number button is pressed.
    - It appends the clicked number to the current entry in the text field.

2. *button_clear()*:
    - This function clears the text field.

3. *button_equal()*:
    - This function is called when the equal button is pressed.
    - It performs the arithmetic operation stored in the math variable using the first number (f_num) and the second number (current entry in the text field).
    - It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

4. *button_add()*:
    - This function is called when the addition button is pressed.
    - It stores the first number and sets the operation to addition.

5. *button_subtract()*:
    - This function is called when the subtraction button is pressed.
    - It stores the first number and sets the operation to subtraction.

6. *button_multiply()*:
    - This function is called when the multiplication button is pressed.
    - It stores the first number and sets the operation to multiplication.

7. *button_divide()*:
    - This function is called when the division button is pressed.
    - It stores the first number and sets the operation to division.

 UI Elements

- *Root Window*:
    - The main window is created using tk.Tk() and titled "Simple Calculator".

- *Entry Widget*:
    - An entry widget is created to display the numbers and results.
    - It spans across four columns to provide enough space for input and results.

- Buttons:
    - Number buttons (0-9) are created with respective commands to handle number clicks.
    - Function buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are created.
    - An equal button is created to evaluate the expression.
    - A clear button is created to reset the entry field.

  Grid Layout:
    - The buttons are arranged in a grid layout to resemble a typical calculator.
    - Each button is placed at a specific row and column for a user-friendly interface.

Button Placement

- The number buttons are placed in a 3x3 grid.
- The 0 button is placed at the bottom left.
- The clear button spans two columns.
- The equal button spans two columns.
- The arithmetic operation buttons are placed in their own rows.

Conclusion

This code provides a functional calculator with a simple and intuitive graphical interface using tkinter. The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations, making it a useful tool for simple calculations. The design leverages global variables and functions to manage the state and perform the required operations, demonstrating the basics of event-driven programming in Python. This implementation is a good starting point for learning how to create interactive GUI applications with tkinter.
